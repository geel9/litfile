# litfile README

## Features

This extension adds syntax highlighting and VSCode language support to .lit files.

You'll need `litfile-compiler` to actually compile .lit files, and some quick code to turn that into a loader for webpack (or whatever you use).


## Known Issues

* Intellisense and autocomplete do not work properly in the \<template\> tag.
